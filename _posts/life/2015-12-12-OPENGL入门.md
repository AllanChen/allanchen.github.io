### 创建渲染缓冲区
<pre class="prettyprint">
GLuint m_renderbuffer;//创建一个渲染缓冲区对象

- (void)setupRenderBuffer {
    glGenRenderbuffers(1, &_colorRenderBuffer);
    glBindRenderbuffer(GL_RENDERBUFFER, _colorRenderBuffer);        
    [_context renderbufferStorage:GL_RENDERBUFFER fromDrawable:_eaglLayer];    
}
</pre>

The next step to use OpenGL is to create a render buffer, which is an OpenGL object that stores the rendered image to present to the screen.

Sometimes you’ll see a render buffer also referred to as a color buffer, because in essence it’s storing colors to display!

There are three steps to create a render buffer:(创建缓冲区的步骤)

* Call glGenRenderbuffers to create a new render buffer object. This returns a unique integer for the the render buffer (we store it here in _colorRenderBuffer). Sometimes you’ll see this unique integer referred to as an “OpenGL name.”

* Call glBindRenderbuffer to tell OpenGL “whenever I refer to GL_RENDERBUFFER, I really mean _colorRenderBuffer.”

* Finally, allocate some storage for the render buffer. The EAGLContext you created earlier has a method you can use for this called renderbufferStorage.
